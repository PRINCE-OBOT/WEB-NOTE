Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the three parts of a web browser:

1. **Window**: This is the global object in the browser that represents the entire browser window or tab. It provides access to properties and methods for controlling the browser, such as opening new windows, setting timeouts, and interacting with the DOM.
    
2. **Navigator**: This object contains information about the browser and the device, such as the user agent, platform, and online status. It helps detect browser capabilities.
    
3. **Document**: This represents the web page loaded in the browser. It provides methods to manipulate the HTML and CSS, allowing developers to change content dynamically. It is part of the DOM (Document Object Model).
