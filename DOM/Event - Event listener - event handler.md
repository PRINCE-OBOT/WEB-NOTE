## Event 

An event is something that happens in the browser, like a user clicking a button, typing in a field, or submitting a form.
Example events:

**"click"** (when a user clicks something)

**"submit"** (when a form is submitted)

**"keydown"** (when a key is pressed)

## Event listener 

An event listener is a method that listens for an event and executes when the event occurs.

*Example*

```
addEventListener('click', handleClick)
```

## Event handler

An event handler is the function that runs when the event happens. It defines what should happen when the event is triggered.

*Example:

```
function handleClick() {
  console.log("Button was clicked!");
}
```
