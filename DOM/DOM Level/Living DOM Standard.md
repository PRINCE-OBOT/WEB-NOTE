As of now, the **DOM specification has moved beyond the "Level" system** and is maintained as a **living standard** by the **WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group)**.

### **Current Status of the DOM**

1. **DOM Level 4 (Draft, Never Finalized)**
    
    - There was a **DOM Level 4 draft**, but it was abandoned in favor of a continuously updated **DOM Living Standard**.
    - Some concepts from the draft were integrated into the modern DOM API.
2. **DOM Living Standard (Ongoing)**
    
    - Instead of defining separate "levels," the DOM is now an evolving standard.
    - The latest version is maintained by **WHATWG**, with continuous updates based on modern web needs.
    - This approach ensures that the **DOM keeps up with JavaScript, browsers, and web APIs** without waiting for versioned releases.

### **Recent Key Features in the Living DOM Standard**

✅ **Mutation Observers** (replaces deprecated mutation events)  
✅ **Shadow DOM & Web Components** (encapsulation for reusable UI components)  
✅ **Improved Keyboard & Pointer Events**  
✅ **New Element Methods (`append()`, `prepend()`, `remove()`, `replaceWith()`)**  
✅ **Better HTML Parsing & Template Handling**

### **Where to Follow Updates?**

- The latest DOM specification is maintained at **[WHATWG DOM Standard](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)**.
- Unlike previous versions, this standard updates **continuously** rather than waiting for a "DOM Level 5".
