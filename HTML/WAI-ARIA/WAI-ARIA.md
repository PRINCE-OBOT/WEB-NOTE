### **What is WAI-ARIA?**

**WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** is a set of attributes that help make **web applications more accessible** to people using assistive technologies like screen readers.

#### **Why is WAI-ARIA Needed?**

HTML provides built-in accessibility for many elements (**like `<button>`, `<input>`, and `<nav>`**), but it **doesn’t cover everything**.  
For example:

- Custom UI elements (like a **custom dropdown menu** made with `<div>` and `<span>`)
    
- Dynamic content that updates without a full page reload (**like live chat or notifications**)
    
- Interactive widgets (**like carousels or modals**)
    

WAI-ARIA **fills these gaps** by adding **roles**, **properties**, and **states** to describe elements better to assistive technologies.
