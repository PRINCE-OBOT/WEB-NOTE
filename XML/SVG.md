Stands for **Scalable Vector Image**, it uses Math formula to generate images.
SVGs are a scalable image format, which means they will easily scale to any size and retain their quality without increasing their filesize.

### SVGs are often used for:

1. Icons
2. Graphs/Charts
3. Large, simple images
4. Patterned backgrounds
5. Applying effects to other elements via SVG filters

### SVGs are defined using:
XML. XML (aka, “Extensible Markup Language”) is an HTML-like syntax which is used for lots of things, from **APIs**, to **RSS**, to **spreadsheet and word editor software**.

### Benefit of SVG 
The fact that SVG source-code is XML has a few key benefits.

1. it means that it is human-readable.

2. XML is designed to be interoperable with HTML, which means you can put the above code directly in an HTML file, without any changes, and it should display the image.
