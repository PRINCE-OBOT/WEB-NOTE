**1. Flex container (the kitchen table):**  
You have a table (the flex container), and you're going to put plates (flex items) on it.

**2. `flex-basis` (the plate's default size before serving):**  
Imagine each plate has a default size. Maybe you planned that each plate should be 200px wide before adding food (that’s your `flex-basis`). This is the starting size.

**If the space on the table is too small or too big, the size can adjust (shrink or grow), but the `flex-basis` is the planned starting point.**

- If you set `flex-basis: 0;`, you're telling the plate: “Forget any default size; just compete for space based on flex-grow.”
- If you set `flex-basis: auto;`, it will first look at the plate's width (if you’ve set one), or its content.

**3. `flex` shorthand (the full rule for growth, shrinkage, and starting size):**  
The `flex` property is like telling the kitchen:

> "This plate can grow this much (flex-grow), can shrink this much (flex-shrink), and its starting planned size is (flex-basis)."

- Example: `flex: 1 1 200px;` means:
    
    - Grow by a factor of 1 if there’s extra space.
    - Shrink by a factor of 1 if there’s less space.
    - Start at a planned size of 200px.
- Example: `flex: 0 1 auto;` means:
    
    - Don't grow.
    - Shrink if necessary.
    - Start based on content or width.
- Example: `flex: 1;` is shorthand for `flex: 1 1 0%;` — start at zero size, but grow and shrink equally to fill up space.
    

**Use case real-life:** If you have 3 plates on the table (3 flex items), and you say:

- Plate 1: `flex: 1;`
- Plate 2: `flex: 2;`
- Plate 3: `flex: 1;`  
    All space left will be divided into 4 parts:
- Plate 1 gets 1 part,
- Plate 2 gets 2 parts,
- Plate 3 gets 1 part.

**Common confusion trap:**  
If you set `flex-basis` and also have width on the element, `flex-basis` will override width unless you use `flex-basis: auto;`.

Rate your understanding by writing in your own words:

- What is `flex-basis`?
- What does `flex: 1;` mean?
- Give me one example where you'd use `flex: 0 1 auto;` in a layout.
