HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies for building web pages:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Defines the structure of a webpage using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. It provides the basic skeleton of a webpage.
    
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Controls the appearance and layout of a webpage. It allows you to style HTML elements, manage positioning, colors, fonts, animations, and responsiveness.
    
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to a webpage. It enables functionalities like form validation, animations, API calls, and user interactions (e.g., clicking buttons, showing/hiding content).
    

Together, they create fully functional, visually appealing, and interactive websites.
