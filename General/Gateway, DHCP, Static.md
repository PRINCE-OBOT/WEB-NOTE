### **Summary of Key Concepts**

- **Gateway**: A device (like a router) that connects different networks and forwards traffic (e.g., your router sending your internet requests).

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network (e.g., your router giving your PC an IP).

- **Static IP**: A manually assigned IP that does not change (e.g., a web server using a fixed IP for accessibility).
