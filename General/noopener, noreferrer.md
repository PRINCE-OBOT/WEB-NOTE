Got it! Let's break it down with actual HTML code examples.

### 1. `rel="noopener"`

The `noopener` attribute prevents the new tab (or window) from having access to the `window.opener` property of the original page. This is mainly a security measure to prevent phishing attacks.

#### **Example with `noopener`:**

```html
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Example (No Access to opener)</a>
```

In this case, if `https://example.com` runs JavaScript like `window.opener.location = "https://malicious-site.com"`, it **won't work** because `rel="noopener"` prevents it from accessing `window.opener`.

### 2. `rel="noreferrer" 
Ensures that when a user clicks a link, the destination page **does not receive the "Referer" header**, which typically contains the URL of the page the user clicked from.

So if you have this link:

```html
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Visit Example</a>
```

When the user clicks it, `https://example.com` **won't know** that the visitor came from your website because the browser won't send the `Referer` header.

This is useful for:

- **Privacy** (hiding the source website)
- **Security** (preventing leakage of sensitive URLs or parameters)
