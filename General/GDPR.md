Let me break it down with a practical example.

Imagine you visit a website, and without asking you, that website sends some of your personal information—like your home address—to a company. You’d probably feel that’s a violation of your privacy, right?

In this case, the website was using **Google Fonts**, a free service that provides different text styles for websites. But instead of storing the fonts on their own servers, the website loaded them directly from Google’s servers. When this happens, **Google automatically gets your IP address**, which is like your home address on the internet.

A German court ruled that this is **illegal under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** because the website didn't ask for permission before sending your IP address to Google. The website owner had to pay **€100 in damages** to the affected person.

The court also said websites should **download and store Google Fonts on their own servers** instead of fetching them from Google, to prevent this kind of data sharing.

A similar case happened in Austria, where a website using **Google Analytics** (a tool that tracks visitors) was found guilty of violating GDPR because it sent user data to Google's servers in the U.S., which could lead to surveillance risks.

In short, the lesson here is: **If you're running a website in Europe, don’t load Google Fonts from Google’s servers—host them locally instead. Otherwise, you could get fined for breaking privacy laws.**
