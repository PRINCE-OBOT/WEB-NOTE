**Interpolation in general** means finding values between two known points.

Real-life example:  
Let’s say you’re driving from City A to City B, and your car’s speed is constant. Every second, you can guess how far you've gone by calculating the distance covered. That guess in-between starting and ending points is interpolation.

Another example:  
If you have 10 apples and your friend has 20 apples, and someone asks, "What if we imagine someone in the middle?" — that imaginary person would have 15 apples. That's interpolation between 10 and 20.

In simple terms:

- Start value: 10
- End value: 20
- Interpolated value halfway: 15

**In math, interpolation means:**  
You calculate missing values between two points, usually by averaging or following a formula.

In computers (CSS, animations, graphics), interpolation helps things move or change gradually from one state to another, filling in all the "small steps" in between so it doesn’t jump suddenly.

I want you to explain interpolation to me in your own words with a real-life example. I’ll rate you!
