The function is closed from the outside because it is an **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)**. This means the function is defined and executed immediately. Let's break this down step by step.

```js
(function() { console.log("Executed immediately"); })();
```

the function runs immediately without needing to be called later.

### **Real-Life Analogy**

Think of an IIFE like **a self-opening box**.

- A normal function is like a box you have to open manually (`myFunction();`).
- An IIFE is like a box that **opens itself** the moment you get it.

### **Final Answer**

The function is closed from the outside **so it executes immediately, remains self-contained, and avoids polluting the global scope**.
