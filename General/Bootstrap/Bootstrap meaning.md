**Bootstrap** can definitely be seen as a **framework**. In fact, it's one of the most popular **front-end frameworks** used for web development. Hereâ€™s why:

### What Makes Bootstrap a Framework?

1. **Pre-built Components**:  
    Bootstrap provides a collection of pre-designed components like buttons, forms, navigation bars, modals, and more. These components are ready to use and help streamline the development process.
    
2. **Grid System**:  
    Bootstrap comes with a responsive, 12-column grid system that allows developers to quickly create layouts that adjust across different screen sizes. This grid system is a key part of the framework and helps ensure that your website is mobile-friendly.
    
3. **CSS and JavaScript**:  
    Bootstrap includes both **CSS** (for styling) and **JavaScript** (for interactive elements like modals, carousels, tooltips, etc.). The framework provides default styles and behaviors that can be customized as needed.
    
4. **Consistency**:  
    By using Bootstrap, you get a consistent, unified design across your web application. This is because Bootstrap's components come with standardized styles, which ensure that buttons, forms, and other elements look and behave similarly regardless of the browser.
    
5. **Customization**:  
    Even though Bootstrap provides defaults, it is customizable. You can modify its Sass variables, change themes, or even create your own components if needed, which adds flexibility.
