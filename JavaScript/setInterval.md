In JavaScript, `setInterval()` is a function that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly at a specified interval (in milliseconds).

The syntax is:

`setInterval(function, delay, arg1, arg2, ...)`

Where:

- `function` is the code to be executed.
- `delay` is the interval (in milliseconds) between executions.
- `arg1`, `arg2`, etc. are optional arguments to be passed to the function.

Here's an example:

```
setInterval(function() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}, 2000);
```

This will log "Hello, world!" to the console every 2 seconds.

`setInterval()` returns an interval ID, which can be used to clear the interval using `clearInterval()`.

Common use cases for `setInterval()` include:

- Updating a clock or timer
- Animating elements on a web page
- Polling for new data or updates
- Running a continuous loop or task

Note that `setInterval()` can be resource-intensive, so use it judiciously and consider alternatives like `setTimeout()` or requestAnimationFrame() when possible.
