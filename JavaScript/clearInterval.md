`clearInterval()` is a JavaScript function that cancels a previously set interval created by `setInterval()`. It stops the execution of the code block associated with the interval.

The syntax is:

`clearInterval(intervalID)`

Where `intervalID` is the ID returned by `setInterval()` when the interval was created.

Here's an example:

```
let intervalID = setInterval(function() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}, 2000);

// Later, when you want to stop the interval...

btn.addEventListener("click", ()=>{
clearInterval(intervalID)
}
;
```
