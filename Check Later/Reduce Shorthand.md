Yes, you can rewrite this function as a one-liner using the `reduce` method like this:

```javascript
const count = string => [...string].reduce((obj, char) => (obj[char] = (obj[char] || 0) + 1, obj), {});
```

### Explanation:

- `[...string]`: Spreads the string into an array of characters.
- `.reduce((obj, char) => (obj[char] = (obj[char] || 0) + 1, obj), {});`
    - If `char` is already in `obj`, it increments its count.
    - Otherwise, it initializes `char` to `1`.
    - The comma operator `,` ensures the function returns `obj`.

This keeps the function concise while maintaining the same functionality.
