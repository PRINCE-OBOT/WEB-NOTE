Faster font delivery yields faster text rendering. In addition, if a font is delivered early enough, this can help eliminate layout shifts resulting from font swapping

>Font swapping happens when the browser temporarily displays fallback fonts while waiting for the custom web font to load. Once the custom font finally arrives, the browser "swaps" the fallback font with the custom one, which can cause the text to suddenly shift position or change appearance.

## Real life analogy 

*"Let's say I open a news website and the text first appears in Times New Roman because the custom font is still loading. A moment later, the custom font arrives, and the text changes to that font, making the layout adjust. That change is font swapping."*
