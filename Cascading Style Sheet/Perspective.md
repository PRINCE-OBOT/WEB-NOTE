The smaller the measuring unit (1px) the more the perspective get more visible.

Example(closer view): Imagine been in front of a skyscraper and looking at the top. The top of the skyscraper tend to be more smaller than the bottom (You have more **distortion**).

And vice versa


More Distortion means there is a very significant influence in the original proportion and visual representation of the image.
