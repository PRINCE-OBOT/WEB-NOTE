### **1. What is a CSS Value?**

A CSS value is the information assigned to a property. For example, in `color: red;`, the value is `red`. Values can take different forms, such as numbers, colors, or percentages. These value types are often written inside angle brackets (e.g., `<color>` or `<length>`) in CSS documentation.

### **2. Numbers, Lengths, and Percentages**

CSS includes different numeric types:

- **Integer (`<integer>`)** – Whole numbers like `10`, `-5`.
- **Number (`<number>`)** – Can have decimals, like `1.5`, `0.75`.
- **Dimension (`<dimension>`)** – A number with a unit, such as `5px` or `10deg`.
- **Percentage (`<percentage>`)** – A fraction of another value, like `50%` of the parent’s width.

### **3. Length Units: Absolute vs. Relative**

**Absolute Units** (fixed sizes, do not change based on the environment):

- `cm` (centimeters)
- `mm` (millimeters)
- `in` (inches)
- `pc` (picas)
- `pt` (points)
- `px` (pixels, commonly used on screens)

**Relative Units** (change based on the surrounding elements):

- `em` – Relative to the parent element’s font size.
- `rem` – Relative to the root (`html`) font size.
- `vw` / `vh` – Relative to the viewport width/height.
- `%` – Relative to the parent element’s size.

**Example:**  
A box with `width: 200px;` is always 200 pixels wide, but `width: 10vw;` changes based on the browser width.

### **4. ems vs. rems**

- `em` depends on the parent element’s font size.
- `rem` depends on the root element’s (`html`) font size.

If you nest elements using `em`, the font size grows exponentially. Using `rem` keeps all text sizes consistent.

### **5. Line Height Units (`lh` and `rlh`)**

- `lh` – Relative to the element’s line height.

```css

p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 24px; /* Line height is 24px */
  margin-bottom: 1lh; /* Margin will be 24px */
}
```

- `rlh` – Relative to the root element’s line height.

```css

html {
  font-size: 18px;
  line-height: 27px; /* Root line height is 27px */
}
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  margin-bottom: 1rlh; /* Margin will be 27px, based on root */
}
```

Used to align text decoration, like creating ruled paper effects.

### **6. Percentages**

Percentages are relative to another element. For example:

- `width: 50%` makes an element half as wide as its parent.
- `font-size: 80%` makes the text 80% of the parent’s font size.

If a box inside a container is `width: 40%`, it will shrink or expand based on the container’s width.
