Think of **hex colors** as a way to mix different amounts of **red, green, and blue (RGB)**, just like mixing paints to get different shades.

### **Breaking Down a Hex Color**

A hex color is written like this:  
**`#RRGGBB`** → Where:

- **RR** (Red) → Controls how much red is in the color.
- **GG** (Green) → Controls how much green is in the color.
- **BB** (Blue) → Controls how much blue is in the color.

Each pair (RR, GG, BB) is a **hexadecimal number** from `00` to `FF`, meaning:

- **00** means none of that color.
- **FF** means the maximum amount of that color.

### **Real-Life Example**

Imagine you have **three lights** in a room: one **red**, one **green**, and one **blue**.

- If you **turn them all off** → The room is **black** (`#000000`).
- If you **turn them all to full brightness** → The room is **white** (`#FFFFFF`).
- If you **only turn on the red light** → The room is **red** (`#FF0000`).
- If you **mix red and green fully** → The room is **yellow** (`#FFFF00`).

### **Understanding Hexadecimal Values**

Hex uses **base-16** instead of base-10 (normal numbers).

- **0 to 9** stay the same.
- **10 to 15** are represented as `A` to `F` (`A=10`, `B=11`, ..., `F=15`).
- `FF` (255 in decimal) is the maximum brightness.

Example:

- **`#00FF00`** → Full **green** (no red, no blue).
- **`#FF00FF`** → Full **red + blue** = **magenta**.
- **`#808080`** → A mix of **half red, half green, half blue** = **gray**.

### **Shortcut Hex (`#RGB`)**

When both digits are the same, you can write just one:

- **`#FFF`** = `#FFFFFF` (White).
- **`#F00`** = `#FF0000` (Red).
- **`#0F0`** = `#00FF00` (Green).
